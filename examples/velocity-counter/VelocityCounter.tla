CONSTANTS
  MaxEvents,    \* model bound: event ids are 1..MaxEvents
  Retention,    \* a tick stays eligible for a query this long
  MaxNow        \* now stops here so cleanup is reachable

ASSUME MaxEvents \in Nat /\ MaxEvents >= 1
ASSUME Retention \in Nat /\ Retention >= 1
ASSUME MaxNow \in Nat /\ MaxNow >= MaxEvents

UserId == "user-1"
IpId == "ip-1"
ApiKeyId == "key-1"
UserBehavior == "message_sent"
IpBehavior == "request"
\* 0 is not an event id. TLC rejects equality between an integer and a string,
\* so the idle marker stays a number.
None == 0

Populations == {"human", "api"}
EventIds == 1..MaxEvents

\* The score is the event id. A second apply does not store a new score.

userKey == <<"user", UserId, UserBehavior>>
ipKey == <<"ip", IpId, IpBehavior>>
apiClientKey == <<"api-client", ApiKeyId, UserBehavior>>

VARIABLES
  population,  \* event id -> "human" or "api"; chosen once
  now,         \* clock; starts at MaxEvents and only increases
  ticks,       \* key -> set of event ids currently stored
  recorded,    \* key -> set of event ids ever stored; cleanup does not touch it
  inflight,    \* None, or the event id of the delivery being applied
  todo         \* keys still to apply for inflight

vars == <<population, now, ticks, recorded, inflight, todo>>

\* API traffic replaces the user key and still names the IP key.

\* Crash, AdvanceNow, and Cleanup are not fair. EventuallyClean is omitted:
\* lazy cleanup may lag.
\*
\* Weak fairness on Deliver and Apply is not enough. A loop can crash
\* before one key, then apply a different event's key, so Apply is taken
\* and is not continuously enabled. Strong fairness on each event and on
\* each event-key pair rules that loop out. Finite crashes are still
\* allowed.
